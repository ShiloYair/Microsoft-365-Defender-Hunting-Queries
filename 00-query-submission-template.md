 BlueCape Study Case - Throttling of MailItemsAccessed :
If more than 1,000 MailItemsAccessed audit records are generated in less than 24 hours, Exchange Online will
stop generating auditing records for MailItemsAccessed activity. When a mailbox is throttled, MailItemsAccessed
activity will not be logged for 24 hours after the mailbox was throttled. If this occurs, there's a potential that
mailbox could have been compromised during this period. The recording of MailItemsAccessed activity will be resumed following a 24-hour period.
